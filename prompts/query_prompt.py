        "1. rewrite - Optimize verbose, conversational, or unclear queries into short, concise, schema-aligned keywords.\n" \
        "2. expand - Enrich short or vague queries with related keywords, synonyms, or semantically relevant phrases.\n" \

        "`company_or_stock_name`, `industry_sector`, `data_month`, `portfolio_management_services_name`. " \
        "Rephrase the user's natural language query into a short, concise set of keywords or phrases " \

        "to improve semantic recall without changing its intent. " \
        "that directly map to these fields and can be used for keyword search. " \

        "Each sub-query should represent a single intent or a distinct piece of information that can be searched independently. " \
        "Keep each sub-query short, clear, and in logical order. " \
        "Avoid conversational words, filler text, or long sentences. " \
        "Output should be sub queries only. No conversation. Maximum 3 subqueries." \
